# Multiple Disaster Management and loss incupancy Solution

***
-> This project is to make an all-purpose solution such that different disaster and losses due to these disaster can be managed easily by any user over thir accounts.

-> These model just not only show the predaciments that are happening but also predicts major occurences that are going to occur over a particular region that the user chooses to monitor.

-> This model also predicts the losses financially due to this disaster for the data and the previous estiamtes that are present for this disaster.

## First the Disaster managed by our System

```
1.) Fire Predicament 
2.) Flood Predicament
3.) Tectonic Predicaments
```

*Though this is the current scope of our project we will continue to expand over this as the time goes on as this require multiple current topological data to function accurately or to say predict properly.*

##  Models made For this project

***
-> The models fo the above funtioned purpose are all either made in Machine Learning or Deep Learning Tech according to the ease of use of data.

-> The First prediction model for the fires in Calfornia is made in a Machine Learning models such that it can be compressed and deployed very easily over the cloud and we find different models accordingly.
***

## The Front End development 

***
-> The front of this system is made from JS, CSS, HTML, NPM and also some elements of Bootstrap.

-> Our Main objective was to make a webpage as responsive to different devices as possible so as to factor in even the smartphone audience as possible without an application.
***

***
-> Will use Basic ReactJS for this project.

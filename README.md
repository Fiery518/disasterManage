A model which uses ML Algos to predict Natural Disasters and Manage them. It is a supervised machine learning model which involves Data Cleaning & EDA followed by applying machine learning techniques.

-> With these models and updates lets see where we get to into this project
-> This projects deals with multiple models in ML and Neural Network models.
